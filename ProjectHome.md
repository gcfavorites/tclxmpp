This project implements an XMPP (RFC-6120 and RFC-6121) library which is to be used for clients, bots and components written in Tcl or Tcl/Tk.

Since the Google code will be closed in near future, this project is moved to Chisel hosting: https://chiselapp.com/user/sgolovan/repository/tclxmpp

Please, get the code from there and report bugs to the new bugtracker https://chiselapp.com/user/sgolovan/repository/tclxmpp/ticket
